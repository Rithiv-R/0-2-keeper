# O2 - Keeper

Project Statement: To demonstrate a project based on Mobile app which would help in oxygen crisis

## Abstract

    This is the project called O2 Keeper which is based on the life keeping gas none other than Oxygen . Due to Covid-19 we were in our homes for past 1 and half year and during the start of 2021 , the Covid â€“ 19 second wave was much stronger than first in India and we lost most our brothers and sisters of the nation and during that stage there was a sudden decline in the amount of the supply of oxygen all around India.

    During that situation we got help from most of volunteers.  This basically gives you the details of the oxygen vendors who is nearby and it also gives you an opportunity to look over Oxygen vendors details in State wise and district wise in India. Even if the third wave of Covid-19 comes too, I hope that this app would be useful in future if there was unexpected crisis of Oxygen. The complete details for this project details mentioned in the upcoming slides
